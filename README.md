## Triva App

Front-end group Project developed while studying at Trybe, a web-development school.

The project was developed in a group following the demands of a __Kanban__ board. It was made with the use of __ReactJS__ and we had the opportunity to improve our skills on __Redux__ by managing the states of the App on it.

With the App running the user is able to:

  - Login the game, if the user has its email registered on the _Gravatar_ site, have its photo assossiated to the user profile.
  - Access the game page and choose one of the presented questions. The answer must be selected before the countdown reaches zero, otherwise the answer will be considered incorrect.
  - Be redirected to the feedback page, where the text displayed will vary depending on the number of the user's correct answers.
  - Check the ranking page after each game, if wanted to.
  - Adjust the settings of the game on the settings page.
